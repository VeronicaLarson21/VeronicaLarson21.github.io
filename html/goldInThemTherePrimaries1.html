        <h1>5/19/2023-Gold in Them There Primaries Part 1</h1>
        <p id="blogParagraphs">
            In 2022, there was an especially conscientious Democratic primary for House District 10 in New York. This primary, with the winner being the defacto winner of the seat (In the previous election the democratic candidate had won by almost 50%), effectively became the election, setting up a clash between the left and center wings of the Democratic Party. In the end, the center won, with Dan Goldman, the fabulously wealthy lawyer, cinching the primary. The mechanics and leftist infighting that lead to this win are interesting, but what I am concerned about today is donations, specifically donations to the top 4 vote getters: Dan Goldman, Yuh-Line Niou, Mondaire Jones, and Carlina Rivera. During the primary accusations of being just another businessman working for businessmen followed Dan Goldman, but what did the demographics of his donations, and the donations of the other relevant candidates look like? This is likely something that has been done before, but this is also a learning experience for myself, in gathering FEC information and expanding upon it using other publicly available resources in order to draw conclusions. I intend to work backwards, posting my analysis of Carlina Rivera first, and making my way backwards to Goldman.
