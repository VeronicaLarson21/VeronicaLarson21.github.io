        <h1>5/16/2023- Introduction</h1>
        <p id="blogParagraphs">This blog will be infrequently updated, and when it is it will be primarily commentary or notes on the many articles I read. It will be a mix of technical, culture, and political articles, reflecting the things I generally care to keep to date with and care about. This blog is also an exersise in learning and evolving web dev skills, so expect random redesigns as I decide to learn things.</p>
