            I want to recreate a simple network stack in python, then if time permits, in C. This stack will model itself after a browser like application, with a URL given and content loaded. Again if time permits, a simple html renderer could be added to turn this into a toy browser but that is a seprate project. The three elements that I will need to implement are: DNS Requests, TCP Connection, HTTP requests. I plan on doing this in order, as I had also already started work on a DNS Request  program in python and taking notes on the concept, using a combination of <a href="https://mislove.org/teaching/cs4700/spring11/handouts/project1-primer.pdf">this</a>  hand out from Alan Mislove's Fundamentals of Computer Networking class, and <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/index.html">this</a> zine by Julia Evans. In general I also expect to draw on <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/index.html">this</a> book, Web Browser Engineering by Pavel Panchekha & Chris Harrelson, and <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/index.html">this</a> book, High Performance Browser Networking by Ilya Grigorik.
