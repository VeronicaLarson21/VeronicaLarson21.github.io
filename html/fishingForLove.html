        <p id="blogParagraphs">
            Recently I read <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/catfishing-customer-support-love/">this</a> article by Wired, and felt it was interesting enough to write about. This type of scamming has existed for a long time, with <a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/84370/2/The_Spanish_Prisoner_Final.pdf">this</a> paper describing a version of a romance scam from the 16th century. The anonymous nature of the internet has obviously lead to this kind of scam exploding, and this article describes how "Industrialized" it has become, with shadowy foreign corporations building almost assembly line like systems for their scamming. This quote stood out to me specifically; "Moderators are encouraged to send 30 messages an hour. For two minutes, Alice says, that means you’re  'a distinguished woman with multiple postgraduate degrees,' then for the next two minutes you’re 'a teenage girl with crazy interests.' ' '" This whole system is incredibly bleak, and its only going to get worse as tools like open-LLM's and open image generators get better and better, and these systems can get bigger and bigger, and as loneliness gets even worse than the almost 58% of Americans who currently are lonely, these industrialized scams are definitely not going away.
