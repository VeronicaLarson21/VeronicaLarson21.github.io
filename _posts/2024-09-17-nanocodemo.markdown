Hello! I am once again trying to get myself to blog and code more, and I came up with a idea that someone has probably done before but I thought was interesting and a way to get me to both blog more and code more. The concept of NaNoWriMo is to write 50k words in one month, writing one full novella or a chunk of a larger project. I aim to create the same for coding and technical writing. I want to challenge myself to write 50k words of blogs, and 10k lines of code over the month of October, then see how close I get, and set a realistic monthly goal based on that to try to hit every month. The remainder of this month I aim to collect projects and plans and things to do over that month, and talk a little about them on here!
